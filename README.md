# MBEasyMod

This library aims to make modding Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord easier by grouping commonly used items and functionality into helper classes with some simple abstraction.
It is far from complete and I have no goal to make it an all encompasing library. It will progress as I need it to and it will develop to my needs and wishes.

## What do I need to do if it is incomplete/not to my liking?

If you want a different usage go for it. I don't use any license and you are free to pull, modify, use or upload as your own.
As this is basically a collection of helper classes I am not concerned with how you use this repo or if you modified it and claimed it as your own.
